# vhdl-bomberman
VHDL for a bomberman game implemented in VHDL on a Zynq-7000 FPGA + resistive touch screen. Part of the assignment was using the free PicoBlaze soft processor core (kcpsm6.vhd). The bytecode for the SPI FSM running on the PicoBlaze core is found in touch_prog_mem.vhd

The top level entity is in top.vhd

A demo of the project can be viewed on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN66qqCFIZs
